# Project Documentation

- [需求理解](./需求理解.md): current product scope, priorities, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
- [方案设计](./方案设计.md): accepted, code-ready design for the first measurable WebRTC proof of concept.
- [Project memory](./project-memory.md): durable decisions and unresolved questions to read at the start of future work.
- [Current status](./status.md): bounded snapshot of the current phase, completed baseline, next step, and blockers.
- [Deployment](./deployment.md): minimal Node, HTTPS/WSS, coturn, firewall, secret, optional TURN/TLS, and network-verification procedure.
- [Maintenance guide](./maintenance.md): Git workflow, context hygiene, document lifecycle, research policy, and automation.
- [P2P WebRTC research](./research/webrtc-p2p-screen-sharing.md): evidence, bandwidth model, browser constraints, reference implementations, and feasibility assessment.
- [Peer-assisted media research](./research/peer-assisted-media.md): browser shared-encode limits, standard relay re-encoding, rejected custom encoded transport, deterministic sticky topology, and abandon gates.
- [Low-server-cost media routes](./research/low-server-media-routes.md): traffic accounting, route screening, conditional native encoded-RTP relay, and explicit SFU fallbacks.
- [Agent context governance research](./research/agent-context-governance.md): official Codex, Claude Code, Hermes Agent, and GitHub practices adopted by this repository.
- [ADR-0001](./adr/0001-p2p-first-media-topology.md): accepted P2P-first media topology and its consequences.
- [ADR-0002](./adr/0002-persistent-protected-rooms.md): optional SQLite persistence, protected sequential room IDs, and room lifecycle.
- [ADR-0004](./adr/0004-peer-assisted-media-experiment.md): proposed, experiment-only standard-WebRTC peer-assisted spike with hard fanout and failure gates.

Documentation and project memory are part of the product source of truth. Update them in the same change that alters the corresponding requirement or architecture.
